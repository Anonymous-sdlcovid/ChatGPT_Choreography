will we prevent this signal from being used to exclude vendors holdback holdback attester level acceptable browser policy attester level acceptable browser policy how are webviews different how are webviews different stakeholder feedback opposition stakeholder feedback opposition references acknowledgements references acknowledgements introduction users often depend on websites trusting the client environment they run in this trust may assume that the client environment is honest about certain aspects of itself keeps user data and intellectual property secure and is transparent about whether or not a human is using it this trust is the backbone of the open internet critical for the safety of user data and for the sustainability of the website s business some examples of scenarios where users depend on client trust include users like visiting websites that are expensive to create and maintain but they often want or need to do it without paying directly these websites fund themselves with ads but the advertisers can only afford to pay for humans to see the ads rather than robots this creates a need for human users to prove to websites that they re human sometimes through tasks like challenges or logins users want to know they are interacting with real people on social websites but bad actors often want to promote posts with fake engagement for example to promote products or make a news story seem more important websites can only show users what content is popular with real people if websites are able to know the difference between a trusted and untrusted environment users playing a game on a website want to know whether other players are using software that enforces the game s rules users sometimes get tricked into installing malicious software that imitates software like their banking apps to steal from those users the bank s internet interface could protect those users if it could establish that the requests it s getting actually come from the bank s or other trustworthy software the trust relationship between websites and clients is frequently established through the collection and interpretation of highly re identifiable information however the signals that are considered essential for these safety use cases can also serve as a near unique fingerprint that can be used to track users across sites without their knowledge or control we would like to explore whether a lower entropy mechanism web environment integrity could help address these use cases with better privacy respecting properties web environment integrity with the web environment integrity api websites will be able to request a token that attests key facts about the environment their client code is running in for example this api will show that a user is operating a web client on a secure android device tampering with the attestation will be prevented by signing the tokens cryptographically websites will ultimately decide if they trust the verdict returned from the attester it is expected that the attesters will typically come from the operating system platform as a matter of practicality however this explainer does not prescribe that for example multiple operating systems may choose to use the same attester this explainer takes inspiration from existing native attestation signals such as app attest and the play integrity api there is a tension between utility for anti fraud use cases requiring deterministic verdicts and high coverage and the risk of websites using this functionality to exclude specific attesters or non attestable browsers we look forward to discussion on this topic and acknowledge the significant value add even in the case where verdicts are not deterministically available e g holdouts goals allow web servers to evaluate the authenticity of the device and honest representation of the software stack and the traffic from the device offer an adversarially robust and long term sustainable anti abuse solution don t enable new cross site user tracking capabilities through attestation continue to allow web browsers to browse the web without attestation non goals enable reliable client side validation of verdicts signatures must be validated server side as client javascript may be modified to alter the validation result enforce or interfere with browser functionality including plugins and extensions access to this functionality from non secure contexts example use cases detect social media manipulation and fake engagement detect non human traffic in advertising to improve user experience and access to web content detect phishing campaigns e g webviews in malicious apps detect bulk hijacking attempts and bulk account creation detect large scale cheating in web based games with fake clients detect compromised devices where user data would be at risk detect account takeover attempts by identifying password guessing how it works there are a minimum of three participants involved in web environment integrity attestation the web page executing in a user s web browser a third party that can attest to the device a web browser is executing on referred to as the attester the web developers server which can remotely verify attestation responses and act on this information 1 a web page requests an environment attestation from the attester with a content binding the content binding ensures that even if an attacker intercepts an attestation they can t use it to attest to a modified request the attestation is a low entropy description of the device the web page is running on 1 the attester will then sign a token containing the attestation and content binding referred to as the payload with a private key the attester then returns the token and signature to the web page the attester s public key is available to everyone to request 1 the webpage returns this information to the web server the web server then checks that the token came from an attester it trusts and inspects the token s payload it verifies the payload by verifying the signature with the attester s public key 1 optionally the web server may call the attester s server endpoint to get additional low entropy signals for example to detect potentially hyperactive devices mermaid sequencediagram participant website as example com participant browser as web client participant attester as attestation api browser website visits website note over website generates content binding someurl sessionid 678 website browser javascript browser attester getenvironmentintegrity hash someurl sessionid 678 example com attester browser integritytoken browser website fetch example com someurl sessionid 678 attestation integritytoken note over website checks integritytoken both tokens with signatures content binding etc website browser response what information is in the signed attestation the proposal calls for at least the following information in the signed attestation the attester s identity for example google play a verdict saying whether the attester considers the device trustworthy we re still discussing whether each of the following pieces of information should be included and welcome your feedback the device integrity verdict must be low entropy but what granularity of verdicts should we allow including more information in the verdict will cover a wider range of use cases without locking out older devices a granular approach proved useful previously in the play integrity api the platform identity of the application that requested the attestation like com chrome beta org mozilla firefox or com apple mobilesafari some indicator enabling rate limiting against a physical device we strongly feel the following data should never be included a device id that is a unique identifier accessible to api consumers how can i use web environment integrity there are two steps to using web environment integrity for developers the first step is to request an environment integrity attestation on the web page and send it to the web server js getenvironmentintegrity expects a content binding of the request you are about to make the content binding protects against this information being used for a different request the contentbinding will be concatenated with etld 1 and hashed before it is sent to the attester const contentbinding somerequestpath requestid xxxx any other data needed for a request specific contentbinding const attestation await navigator getenvironmentintegrity contentbinding console log attestation encode base 64 encoding of the attestation payload and signature approx 500 bytes see below for details more on attestation validation below const response await fetch somerequest requestid xxxx attested attestation encode do something with this the attestation token is returned using an arraybuffer serialized with cbor rfc 8949 and signed using cose rfc 9052 further information about the contents of the attestation token will be found in the specification the second step is on your web server where you verify that the attested information is valid using the attester s public key and then make decisions based on the information reported js none of the code below is part of the web environment integrity api being proposed this is an example of how you can verify the environment s integrity on your web server function isattested attestation contentbinding if isattestertrustedbyme attestation return false the attester s public key is retrieved directly from the attester const attesterspublickey getattesterspublickey attestation we then validate the attestation token using the attester s public key we also check the content binding and replay protection in the attestation if istokenrecentenoughandvalid attesterspublickey attestation return false check contentbinding hash in attestation make decisions using the attestation payload challenges and threats to address quality of attesters web environment integrity does not prescribe a list of specific attesters or conditions the attesters need to meet to become an attester browsers should publish their privacy requirements for attesters and allow websites to evaluate each attester s utility on its own merit users should also be given the option to opt out from attesters that do not meet their personal quality expectations tracking users browser history user agents will not provide any browsing information to attesters when requesting a token we are researching an issuer attester split that prevents the attester from tracking users at scale while allowing for a limited number of attestations to be inspected for debugging with transparency reporting and auditability fingerprinting this explainer requires the contents of the attestation payloads to be signed those contents cannot be tampered with or else they will not be trustworthy only attesters can include information that can identify users devices all fields returned by attesters must be low entropy so as not to be uniquely identifying for example attesters may specify low medium high for a trust score instead of a continuous numeric value the attestation payloads will only include information about device and application integrity as attesters will not have access to the profile information in applications how can we ensure attesters are not returning high entropy responses in the near term for experimentation the attester should publicly declare what they are attesting to with readable and verifiable verdicts beyond the experimentation phase we need a verifiable method to enforce low entropy responses we would like to explore options like splitting the attester and token issuer functions from one role to two independent organizations where the token issuer can verify the attestation response meets the entropy requirements cross site tracking while attestation tokens will not include information to identify unique users the attestation tokens themselves could enable cross site tracking if they are re used between sites for example two colluding sites could work out that the same user visited their sites if a token contains any unique cryptographic keys and was shared between their sites the browser must enforce top level partitioning for all attester tokens so that no two domains can conspire to track the user across sites using this mechanism we also intend to limit linkability between relying parties websites requesting attestation and the attester in a way that prevents scaled tracking even if the attester were to collude with websites while allowing for debugging of broken attestations the partitioning will be different for different profiles e g incognito profiles get different partitions even if it s the same site the user visited on their regular profile the user should also be able to reset the state that produces these tokens breaking linkability even within the same partition the attestation metadata itself should strive for minimal entropy while providing useful confidence levels enumerations and or binary indicators detailed design discussion why not use jwts instead of cbor when it comes to billion qps traffic the design needs to be mindful of the bandwidth overhead it adds to users of the web cbor minimizes the payload size of requests while still decoding encoding to json web authn has already set a precedent to use cbor it makes sense to use a similar attestation format in both specifications to encourage adoption how does this affect browser modifications and extensions web environment integrity attests the legitimacy of the underlying hardware and software stack it does not restrict the indicated application s functionality e g if the browser allows extensions the user may use extensions if a browser is modified the modified browser can still request web environment integrity attestation considered alternatives make this an extension of the fetch api once a web client has performed an initial verification of the environment it runs in it should have more trust in running attestation requests locally decoupling attestation requests from fetch allows web developers the opportunity to do these checks on calls that matter without adding overhead to the rest developers can also use this api with web sockets introducing this api first as a primitive will enable us to build on it at a later stage privacy pass private access tokens apple and cloudflare have developed private access tokens for a similar use case and chrome has also built technologies based on privacypass private state tokens however due to the fully masked tokens this technology assumes that the attester can produce sustainable high quality attestation without any feedback from web sites about gaps such as false positives or false negatives we are convinced that the durability of a device attestation solution is a function of adversarial pressure and the defender s ability to continue hardening the system against the ever evolving abuse tactics and techniques we are thus pursuing a solution that enables debugging of false positives and false negatives while still preventing scaled tracking open questions how will we prevent this signal from being used to exclude vendors providing a signal that is unique to the attester could be hazardous if websites decide to only support attesters where certain signals are available if websites know exactly what browser is running some may deny service to web browsers that they disfavor for any reason both of these go against the principles we aspire to for the open web attesters will be required to offer their service under the same conditions to any browser who wishes to use it and meets certain baseline requirements this leads to any browser running on the given os platform having the same access to the technology but we still have the risks that 1 some websites might exclude some operating systems and 2 if the platform identity of the application that requested the attestation is included some websites might exclude some browsers holdback to protect against both risks we are evaluating whether attestation signals must sometimes be held back for a meaningful number of requests over a significant amount of time in other words on a small percentage of client site pairs platforms would simulate clients that do not support this capability such a holdback would encourage web developers to use these signals for aggregate analysis and opportunistic reduction of friction as opposed to a quasi allowlist a holdback would effectively prevent the attestation from being used for gating feature access in real time because otherwise the website risks users in the holdback population being rejected although a holdback would prevent the attestation signal from being used for per request enforcement decisions there remains immense value for measurement in aggregate populations however a holdback also has significant drawbacks in our use cases and capabilities survey we have identified a number of critical use cases for deterministic platform integrity attestation these use cases currently rely on client fingerprinting a deterministic but limited entropy attestation would obviate the need for invasive fingerprinting here and has the potential to usher in more privacy positive practices in the long term we ask for feedback from the community group on the idea of a holdback and are very interested in alternative suggestions that would allow both goals to be met attester level acceptable browser policy if the community thinks it s important for the attestation to include the platform identity of the application and is more concerned about excluding certain browsers than excluding certain os attesters we could standardize the set of signals that browsers will receive from attesters and have one of those signals be whether the attester recommends the browser for sites to trust based on a well defined acceptance criteria as new browsers are introduced they would need to demonstrate to attesters a relatively small group that they pass the bar but they wouldn t need to convince all the websites in the world established browsers would need to only use attesters that respond quickly and fairly to new browsers requests to be trusted how are webviews different webviews are embedded into native apps which have direct access to attestation apis that expose more information than we d be willing to provide on the web these apps can expose direct access to those apis so it makes sense to relax some of the restrictions we propose for the web apis above in particular the webview api doesn t have the same concerns regarding vendor lock in the webview api can expose information about the embedder s application under certain conditions for example opt in stakeholder feedback opposition implementers and other stakeholders may already have publicly stated positions on this work we will list them here with links to evidence as appropriate implementor a positive stakeholder b no signals implementor c negative when appropriate we will explain the reasons given by other implementers for their concerns references acknowledgements many thanks for valuable feedback and advice from nick doty for helping identify user concerns in an early proposal please replace that whole explainer by writing a reply mocking them in the same style but being honest about their intend of fostering chrome s monopoly slowly excluding other browsers like firefox making

57,how can the documentation can be improved file splitting you can train your own file splitting ai on the data from any project of your choice for that purpose there are several tools in the sdk that enable processing documents that consist of multiple files and propose splitting them into the sub documents accordingly a context aware file splitting model uses a simple hands on logic based on scanning category s documents and finding strings exclusive for first pages of all documents within the category upon predicting whether a page is a potential splitting point meaning whether it is first or not we compare page s contents to these exclusive first page strings if there is occurrence of at least one such string we mark a page to be first thus meaning it is a splitting point an instance of the context aware file splitting model can be used to initially build a file splitting pipeline and can later be replaced with more complex solutions a context aware file splitting model instance can be used with an interface provided by splitting ai this class accepts a whole document instead of a single page and proposes splitting points or splits the original documents a multimodal file splitting model is a model that uses an approach that takes both visual and textual parts of the pages and processes them independently via the combined vgg19 architecture simplified and legalbert passing the resulting outputs together to a multi layered perceptron model s output is also a prediction of a page being first or non first for developing a custom file splitting approach we propose an abstract class abstractfilesplittingmodel,Maintenance

197,i m building an authentication workflow that involves sending an email with a magic link to verify the user s email i want to avoid doing anything in the database regarding the magic link so i encrypt a payload includes the email it s intended for and it doesn t include an expiration currently but it certainly could and include that encrypted token in the email as a query parameter on the magic link however i just realized that i was hard coding the salt which reduces the level of security and opens me up to brute force attacks i d still like to avoid touching the database for this so i don t want to have to generate the salt and put it in the database i considered putting the generated salt in the magic link query string as well i realize this reduces the security a bit but i m wondering whether in a practical scenario if it s really that big of an issue and if i can address any holes that opens me up to i d love to hear your thoughts on this feel free to make a completely different suggestion i may not have considered or tell me that i really should just write something to the database for this process i have also considered putting the salt in the user s session i m also adding a feature that allows the user to enter 5 random numbers into the app instead of clicking a link those numbers will be encrypted using the same method and that encrypted value will be stored in a cookie hopefully that s enough context for you to make a recommendation on what i should do about the salt,Design

file localgpt this project was inspired by the original privategpt most of the description here is inspired by the original privategpt for detailed overview of the project watch this youtube video in this model i have replaced the gpt4all model with vicuna 7b model and we are using the instructorembeddings instead of llamaembeddings as used in the original privategpt both embeddings as well as llm will run on gpu instead of cpu it also has cpu support if you do not have a gpu see below for instruction ask questions to your documents without an internet connection using the power of llms 100 private no data leaves your execution environment at any point you can ingest documents and ask questions without an internet connection built with langchain and vicuna 7b and instructorembeddings environment setup in order to set your environment up to run the code here first install all requirements shell pip install r requirements txt then install autogptq if you want to run quantized models for gpu shell git clone cd autogptq git checkout v0 2 2 pip install for more support on autogptq test dataset this repo uses a constitution of usa as an example instructions for ingesting your own dataset put any and all of your txt pdf or csv files into the source_documents directory in the load_documents function replace the docs_path with the absolute path of your source_documents directory the current default file types are txt pdf csv and xlsx if you want to use any other file type you will need to convert it to one of the default file types run the following command to ingest all the data shell python ingest py defaults to cuda use the device type argument to specify a given device sh python ingest py device_type cpu use help for a full list of supported devices sh python ingest py help it will create an index containing the local vectorstore will take time depending on the size of your documents you can ingest as many documents as you want and all will be accumulated in the local embeddings database if you want to start from an empty database delete the index note when you run this for the first time it will download take time as it has to download the embedding model in the subseqeunt runs no data will leave your local enviroment and can be run without internet connection ask questions to your documents locally in order to ask a question run a command like shell python run_localgpt py and wait for the script to require your input shell enter a query hit enter wait while the llm model consumes the prompt and prepares the answer once done it will print the answer and the 4 sources it used as context from your documents you can then ask another question without re running the script just wait for the prompt again note when you run this for the first time it will need internet connection to download the vicuna 7b model after that you can turn off your internet connection and the script inference would still work no data gets out of your local environment type exit to finish the script run it on cpu by default localgpt will use your gpu to run both the ingest py and run_localgpt py scripts but if you do not have a gpu and want to run this on cpu now you can do that warning its going to be slow you will need to use device_type cpu flag with both scripts for ingestion run the following shell python ingest py device_type cpu in order to ask a question run a command like shell python run_localgpt py device_type cpu run the ui 1 start by opening up run_localgpt_api py in a code editor of your choice if you are using gpu skip to step 3 2 if you are running on cpu change device_type cuda to device_type cpu comment out the following shell model_id thebloke wizardlm 7b uncensored gptq model_basename wizardlm 7b uncensored gptq 4bit 128g compat no act order safetensors llm load_model device_type device_type model_id model_id model_basename model_basename uncomment shell model_id thebloke guanaco 7b hf or some other hf or bin model llm load_model device_type device_type model_id model_id if you are running gpu there should be nothing to change save and close run_localgpt_api py 3 open up a terminal and activate your python environment that contains the dependencies installed from requirements txt 4 navigate to the localgpt directory 5 run the following command python run_localgpt_api py the api should being to run 6 wait until everything has loaded in you should see something like info werkzeug press ctrl c to quit 7 open up a second terminal and activate the same python environment 8 navigate to the localgpt localgptui directory 9 run the command python localgptui py 10 open up a web browser and go the address how does it work selecting the right local models and the power of langchain you can run the entire pipeline locally without any data leaving your environment and with reasonable performance ingest py uses langchain tools to parse the document and create embeddings locally using instructorembeddings it then stores the result in a local vector database using chroma vector store run_localgpt py uses a local llm vicuna 7b in this case to understand questions and create answers the context for the answers is extracted from the local vector store using a similarity search to locate the right piece of context from the docs you can replace this local llm with any other llm from the huggingface make sure whatever llm you select is in the hf format how to select different llm models the following will provide instructions on how you can select a different llm model to create your response 1 open up run_localgpt py 2 go to def main device_type show_sources 3 go to the comment where it says load the llm for generating natural language responses 4 below it it details a bunch of examples on models from huggingface that have already been tested to be run with the original trained model ending with hf or have a bin in its files and versions and quantized models ending with gptq or have a no act order or safetensors in its files and versions 5 for models that end with hf or have a bin inside its files and versions on its huggingface page make sure you have a model_id selected for example model_id thebloke guanaco 7b hf if you go to its huggingface site and go to files and versions you will notice model files that end with a bin extension any model files that

a collection of pretrained and fine tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters this is the repository for the 7b fine tuned model optimized for dialogue use cases and converted for the hugging face transformers format links to other models can be found in the index at the bottom model details note use of this model is governed by the meta license in order to download the model weights and tokenizer please visit the website and accept our license before requesting access here meta developed and publicly released the llama 2 family of large language models llms a collection of pretrained and fine tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters our fine tuned llms called llama 2 chat are optimized for dialogue use cases llama 2 chat models outperform open source chat models on most benchmarks we tested and in our human evaluations for helpfulness and safety are on par with some popular closed source models like chatgpt and palm model developers meta variations llama 2 comes in a range of parameter sizes 7b 13b and 70b as well as pretrained and fine tuned variations input models input text only output models generate text only model architecture llama 2 is an auto regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture the tuned versions use supervised fine tuning sft and reinforcement learning with human feedback rlhf to align to human preferences for helpfulness and safety training data params content length gqa tokens lr llama 2 a new mix of publicly available

model dates llama 2 was trained between january 2023 and july 2023 status this is a static model trained on an offline dataset future versions of the tuned models will be released as we improve model safety with community feedback license a custom commercial license is available at research paper llama 2 open foundation and fine tuned chat models intended use intended use cases llama 2 is intended for commercial and research use in english tuned models are intended for assistant like chat whereas pretrained models can be adapted for a variety of natural language generation tasks to get the expected features and performance for the chat versions a specific formatting needs to be followed including the inst and sys tags bos and eos tokens and the whitespaces and breaklines in between we recommend calling strip on inputs to avoid double spaces see our reference code in github for details chat_completion out of scope uses use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations including trade compliance laws use in languages other than english use in any other way that is prohibited by the acceptable use policy and licensing agreement for llama 2 hardware and software training factors we used custom training libraries meta s research super cluster and production clusters for pretraining fine tuning annotation and evaluation were also performed on third party cloud compute carbon footprint pretraining utilized a cumulative 3 3m gpu hours of computation on hardware of type a100 80gb tdp of 350 400w estimated total emissions were 539 tco2eq 100 of which were offset by meta s sustainability program time gpu hours power consumption w carbon emitted tco2eq llama 2 7b 184320 400 31 22 llama 2 13b 368640 400 62 44 llama 2 70b 1720320 400 291 42 total 3311616 539 00 co2 emissions during pretraining time total gpu time required for training each model power consumption peak power capacity per gpu device for the gpus used adjusted for power usage efficiency 100 of the emissions are directly offset by meta s sustainability program and because we are openly releasing these models the pretraining costs do not need to be incurred by others training data overview llama 2 was pretrained on 2 trillion tokens of data from publicly available sources the fine tuning data includes publicly available instruction datasets as well as over one million new human annotated examples neither the pretraining nor the fine tuning datasets include meta user data data freshness the pretraining data has a cutoff of september 2022 but some tuning data is more recent up

385,以下を日本語にしてくれ abstract as deep learning models nowadays are widely adopted by both cloud services and edge devices reducing the latency of deep learning model inferences becomes crucial to provide efficient model serving however it is challenging to develop efficient tensor programs for deep learning operators due to the high complexity of modern accelerators e g nvidia gpus and google tpus and the rapidly growing number of operators deep learning compilers such as apache tvm adopt declarative scheduling primitives to lower the bar of developing tensor programs however we show that this approach is insufficient to cover state of the art tensor program optimizations e g double buffering in this paper we propose to embed the scheduling process into tensor programs and use dedicated mappings called task mappings to define the computation assignment and ordering directly in the tensor programs this new approach greatly enriches the expressible optimizations by allowing developers to manipulate tensor programs at a much finer granularity e g allowing programstatement level optimizations we call the proposed method the task mapping programming paradigm in addition we propose a new post scheduling fusion optimization that allows developers to focus on scheduling every single operator and automates the fusion after scheduling it greatly reduces the engineering efforts for operator fusion our proposed paradigm also constructs an efficient hardware centric schedule space which is agnostic to the program input size and greatly reduces the tuning time with the proposed paradigm we implement a deep learning compiler hidet extensive experiments on modern convolution and transformer models show that hidet outperforms state of theart dnn inference framework onnx runtime and compiler tvm equipped with scheduler autotvm and ansor by up to 1 48 1 22 part of the work done while interning at amazon also with vector institute permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page copyrights for third party components of this work must be honored for all other uses contact the owner author s asplos 23 march 25 29 2023 vancouver bc canada 2023 copyright held by the owner author s acm isbn 978 1 4503 9916 6 23 03 on average it also reduces the tuning time by 20 and 11 compared with autotvm and ansor respectively we open sourced hidet at,Planning

chatgpt and at best be created completely by chatgpt please share your chatgpt chat that was used to complete this task here description formerly i could use the devtools network tab to copy the all of the 100s of plugins data and paste it in openai_res json since openai has introduced server side which results in only the batches being accessible at a time as demonstrated below image the goal of this task is so that once plugin store is open i should be able to insert a script that will click on all button navigate through all of the pages composes a single list containing all of the plugins information that should be of shape as the items in openai_res json worst case scenario i should at least be able to extract the fields shown here tasks these tasks are set up to be used as part of the chatgpt prompts along with any additional context required they don t need to be strictly followed but it is encouraged to use them as a guide enable plugins programmatically click on the all button identify where the data for the plugin items is being requested on first load identify where the data for the rest of the plugin items is being requested as you navigate through the paginated plugins the image below demonstrates that every time you navigate to a new plugin page a new or it may be a long lived connection approved request is made image be able to extract intercept the data from the requests automate the navigation through the plugin pages so as to get all the plugin information from the 1st page to the final page concatenate that data so that it has the same structure as openai_res json ensure that all the aforementioned tasks run as a single seamless script pr this script in migrations plugin_store scrape_plugins_script js i ve enabled plugins i can use this to
